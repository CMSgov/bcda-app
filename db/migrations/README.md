# Database Schema Changes

## Philosophy
* All database changes will be modelled in discrete schema migrations
    * Code to roll back a migration will be included unless highly impracticable
* Migrations will receive unique sequential integer identifiers.
    * Engineers should keep aware of identifier collisions (and in some instances required migration order), and adjust their migration IDâ€™s before merging with master, if necessary.
* Migrations will be written with production environments in mind
    * If data changes are required (default values instead of nulls, compound fields broken apart, etc.), the migration will include commands for these transformations.
    * If the migration would break running instances, reasonable effort will be made to write multiple migrations.  In the first migration, a non-breaking transition schema will be used that can support both the old and new code versions.  After all instances have been upgraded, the final version of the schema can be introduced in a second migration.
* Migrations will be tested with unit tests.  This includes the code for rolling back a migration.
* Migrations will be run as the first step of a code deployment.  Migration failure will cancel the deployment.
* Migrations will use transactions to ensure that failure rolls back the database to a valid state.
* GORM auto-migrate will be deprecated in favor of explicit migrations

## File Structure
* `./bcda` contains migrations for the bcda database
* `./bcda_queue` contains migrations for the bcda_queue database
## How-to
* Create migration scripts
    * Follow the philosophy above.  For example: will this schema change break production systems?  Consider making a multi-stage migration/deployment.
    * Using [migrate CLI](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate) create a baseline SQL script for each schema change for the targeted database.
      * Ex: `migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migrations/bcda_queue -seq initial_schema`
    * Update the *.up.sql and *.down.sql files with schema changes. Be sure to perform these changes in a transaction `BEGIN;...COMMIT;`
    * Add tests for both scripts in `migrations_test.go`
* A Note on creating new tables
    * We use the `created_at` and `updated_at` rows for auditing purposes. They are separated and not included in our Go models. When creating new tables, these columns should
    be added in and should default to `now()`. Furthermore, `updated_at` for the new table should be assigned the trigger `trigger_set_timestamp()` so that the column will
    update the row automatically to the current time. You can find examples of this in the migration files.

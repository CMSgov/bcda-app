Package `sqlbuilder` provides a set of flexible and powerful SQL string builders. The only goal of this package is to build SQL string with arguments which can be used in `DB#Query` or `DB#Exec` defined in package `database/sql`.

## Install

Use `go get` to install this package.

```shell
go get github.com/huandu/go-sqlbuilder
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

Here is a sample to demonstrate how to build a SELECT query.

```go
sb := sqlbuilder.NewSelectBuilder()

sb.Select("id", "name", sb.As("COUNT(*)", "c"))
sb.From("user")
sb.Where(sb.In("status", 1, 2, 5))

sql, args := sb.Build()
fmt.Println(sql)
fmt.Println(args)

// Output:
// SELECT id, name, COUNT(*) AS c FROM user WHERE status IN (?, ?, ?)
// [1 2 5]
```

Following builders are implemented right now. API document and examples are provided in the `godoc` document.

- [Buildf](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/huandu/go-sqlbuilder#Buildf): Freestyle builder using `fmt.Sprintf`-like syntax.
- [Build](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/huandu/go-sqlbuilder#Build): Advanced freestyle builder using special syntax defined in [Args#Compile](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/huandu/go-sqlbuilder#Args.Compile).
- [BuildNamed](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/huandu/go-sqlbuilder#BuildNamed): Advanced freestyle builder using `${key}` to refer the value of a map by key.

### Build SQL for MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite

Parameter markers are different in MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. This package provides some methods to set the type of markers (we call it "flavor") in all builders.

By default, all builders uses `DefaultFlavor` to build SQL. The default value is `MySQL`.

There is a `BuildWithFlavor` method in `Builder` interface. We can use it to build a SQL with provided flavor.

We can wrap any `Builder` with a default flavor through `WithFlavor`.

To be more verbose, we can use `PostgreSQL.NewSelectBuilder()` to create a `SelectBuilder` with the `PostgreSQL` flavor. All builders can be created in this way.

Right now, there are only three flavors, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL` and `SQLite`. Open new issue to me to ask for a new flavor if you find it necessary.

### Using `Struct` as a light weight ORM

`Struct` stores type information and struct fields of a struct. It's a factory of builders. We can use `Struct` methods to create initialized SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE builders to work with the struct. It can help us to save time and avoid human-error on writing column names.

We can define a struct type and use field tags to let `Struct` know how to create right builders for us.

```go
type ATable struct {
    Field1     string                                    // If a field doesn't has a tag, use "Field1" as column name in SQL.
    Field2     int    `db:"field2"`                      // Use "db" in field tag to set column name used in SQL.
    Field3     int64  `db:"field3" fieldtag:"foo,bar"`   // Set fieldtag to a field. We can use methods like `Struct#SelectForTag` to use it.
    Field4     int64  `db:"field4" fieldtag:"foo"`       // If we use `s.SelectForTag(table, "foo")`, columnes of SELECT are field3 and field4.
    Ignored    int32  `db:"-"`                           // If we set field name as "-", Struct will ignore it.
    unexported int                                       // Unexported field is not visible to Struct.
    Quoted     string `db:"quoted" fieldopt:"withquote"` // Add quote to the field using back quote or double quote. See `Flavor#Quote`.
    Empty      uint   `db:"empty" fieldopt:"omitempty"`  // Omit the field in UPDATE if it is a nil or zero value.

    // The `omitempty` can be written as a function.
    // In this case, omit empty field `Tagged` when UPDATE for tag `tag1` and `tag3` but not `tag2`.
    Tagged     string `db:"tagged" fieldopt:"omitempty(tag1,tag3)" fieldtag:"tag1,tag2,tag3"`
}
```

Read [examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/huandu/go-sqlbuilder#Struct) for `Struct` to learn details of how to use it.

What's more, we can use `Struct` as a kind of zero-config ORM. While most ORM implementations requires several prerequisite configs to work with database connections, `Struct` doesn't require any config and work well with any SQL driver which works with `database/sql`. `Struct` doesn't call any `database/sql` API; It just creates right SQL with arguments for `DB#Query`/`DB#Exec` or a slice of address of struct fields for `Rows#Scan`/`Row#Scan`.

Here is a sample to use `Struct` as ORM. It should be quite straight forward for developers who are familiar with `database/sql` APIs.

```go
type User struct {
    ID     int64  `db:"id"`
    Name   string `db:"name"`
    Status int    `db:"status"`
}

// A global variable to create SQL builders.
// All methods of userStruct are thread-safe.
var userStruct = NewStruct(new(User))

func ExampleStruct() {
    // Prepare SELECT query.
    //     SELECT id, name, status FROM user WHERE id = 1234
    sb := userStruct.SelectFrom("user")
    sb.Where(sb.Equal("id", 1234))

    // Execute the query.
    sql, args := sb.Build()
    rows, _ := db.Query(sql, args...)
    defer rows.Close()

    // Scan row data and set value to user.
    // Suppose we get following data.
    //
    //     |  id  |  name  | status |
    //     |------|--------|--------|
    //     | 1234 | huandu | 1      |
    var user User
    rows.Scan(userStruct.Addr(&user)...)

    fmt.Println(sql)
    fmt.Println(args)
    fmt.Printf("%#v", user)

    // Output:
    // SELECT user.id, user.name, user.status FROM user WHERE id = ?
    // [1234]
    // sqlbuilder.User{ID:1234, Name:"huandu", Status:1}
}
```

### Nested SQL

It's quite straight forward to create a nested SQL: use a builder as an argument to nest it.

Here is a sample.

```go
sb := sqlbuilder.NewSelectBuilder()
fromSb := sqlbuilder.NewSelectBuilder()
statusSb := sqlbuilder.NewSelectBuilder()

sb.Select("id")
sb.From(sb.BuilderAs(fromSb, "user")))
sb.Where(sb.In("status", statusSb))

fromSb.Select("id").From("user").Where(fromSb.GreaterThan("level", 4))
statusSb.Select("status").From("config").Where(statusSb.Equal("state", 1))

sql, args := sb.Build()
fmt.Println(sql)
fmt.Println(args)

// Output:
// SELECT id FROM (SELECT id FROM user WHERE level > ?) AS user WHERE status IN (SELECT status FROM config WHERE state = ?)
// [4 1]
```

### Use `sql.Named` in a builder

The function `sql.Named` defined in `database/sql` can create a named argument in SQL. It's necessary if we want to reuse an argument several times in one SQL. It's still quite simple to use named arguments in a builder: use it as an argument.

Here is a sample.

```go
now := time.Now().Unix()
start := sql.Named("start", now-86400)
end := sql.Named("end", now+86400)
sb := sqlbuilder.NewSelectBuilder()

sb.Select("name")
sb.From("user")
sb.Where(
    sb.Between("created_at", start, end),
    sb.GE("modified_at", start),
)

sql, args := sb.Build()
fmt.Println(sql)
fmt.Println(args)

// Output:
// SELECT name FROM user WHERE created_at BETWEEN @start AND @end AND modified_at >= @start
// [{{} start 1514458225} {{} end 1514544625}]
```

### Argument modifiers

There are several modifiers for arguments.

- `List(arg)` represents a list of arguments. If `arg` is a slice or array, e.g. a slice with 3 ints, it will be compiled to `?, ?, ?` and flattened in the final arguments as 3 ints. It's a tool for convenience. We can use it in the `IN` expression or `VALUES` of `INSERT INTO`.
- `Named(name, arg)` represents a named argument. It only works with `Build` or `BuildNamed` to define a named placeholder using syntax `${name}`.
- `Raw(expr)` marks an `expr` as a plain string in SQL rather than an argument. When we build a builder, the value of raw expressions are copied in SQL string directly without leaving any `?` in SQL.

### Freestyle builder

A builder is only a way to record arguments. If we want to build a long SQL with lots of special syntax (e.g. special comments for a database proxy), simply use `Buildf` to format a SQL string using a `fmt.Sprintf`-like syntax.

```go
sb := sqlbuilder.NewSelectBuilder()
sb.Select("id").From("user")

explain := sqlbuilder.Buildf("EXPLAIN %v LEFT JOIN SELECT * FROM banned WHERE state IN (%v, %v)", sb, 1, 2)
sql, args := explain.Build()
fmt.Println(sql)
fmt.Println(args)

// Output:
// EXPLAIN SELECT id FROM user LEFT JOIN SELECT * FROM banned WHERE state IN (?, ?)
// [1 2]
```

### Using special syntax to build SQL

Package `sqlbuilder` defines special syntax to represent an uncompiled SQL internally. If we want to take advantage of the syntax to build customized tools, we can use `Build` to compile it with arguments.

The format string uses special syntax to represent arguments.

- `$?` refers successive arguments passed in the call. It works similar as `%v` in `fmt.Sprintf`.
- `$0` `$1` ... `$n` refers nth-argument passed in the call. Next `$?` will use arguments n+1.
- `${name}` refers a named argument created by `Named` with `name`.
- `$$` is a `"$"` string.

```go
sb := sqlbuilder.NewSelectBuilder()
sb.Select("id").From("user").Where(sb.In("status", 1, 2))

b := sqlbuilder.Build("EXPLAIN $? LEFT JOIN SELECT * FROM $? WHERE created_at > $? AND state IN (${states}) AND modified_at BETWEEN $2 AND $?",
    sb, sqlbuilder.Raw("banned"), 1514458225, 1514544625, sqlbuilder.Named("states", sqlbuilder.List([]int{3, 4, 5})))
sql, args := b.Build()

fmt.Println(sql)
fmt.Println(args)

// Output:
// EXPLAIN SELECT id FROM user WHERE status IN (?, ?) LEFT JOIN SELECT * FROM banned WHERE created_at > ? AND state IN (?, ?, ?) AND modified_at BETWEEN ? AND ?
// [1 2 1514458225 3 4 5 1514458225 1514544625]
```

If we just want to use `${name}` syntax to refer named arguments, use `BuildNamed` instead. It disables all special syntax but `${name}` and `$$`.

### Interpolate `args` in the `sql`

Some SQL drivers doesn't actually implement `StmtExecContext#ExecContext`. They will fail when `len(args) > 0`. The only solution is to interpolate `args` in the `sql`, and execute the interpolated query with the driver.

_Security warning_: I try my best to escape special characters in interpolate methods, but it's still less secure than `Stmt` implemented by SQL servers.

This feature is inspired by interpolation feature in package `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`.

Here is a sample for MySQL.

```go
sb := MySQL.NewSelectBuilder()
sb.Select("name").From("user").Where(
    sb.NE("id", 1234),
    sb.E("name", "Charmy Liu"),
    sb.Like("desc", "%mother's day%"),
)
sql, args := sb.Build()
query, err := MySQL.Interpolate(sql, args)

fmt.Println(query)
fmt.Println(err)

// Output:
// SELECT name FROM user WHERE id <> 1234 AND name = 'Charmy Liu' AND desc LIKE '%mother\'s day%'
// <nil>
```

Here is a sample for PostgreSQL. Note that the dollar quote is supported.

```go
// Only the last `$1` is interpolated.
// Others are not interpolated as they are inside dollar quote (the `$$`).
query, err := PostgreSQL.Interpolate(`
CREATE FUNCTION dup(in int, out f1 int, out f2 text) AS $$
    SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text'
$$
LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT * FROM dup($1);`, []interface{}{42})

fmt.Println(query)
fmt.Println(err)

// Output:
//
// CREATE FUNCTION dup(in int, out f1 int, out f2 text) AS $$
//     SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text'
// $$
// LANGUAGE SQL;
//
// SELECT * FROM dup(42);
// <nil>
```

## FAQ

### What's the difference between this package and `squirrel`

Package [squirrel](https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel) is another SQL builder package with outstanding design and high code quality.
Comparing with `squirrel`, `go-sqlbuilder` is much more extensible with more built-in features.

Here are details.

- API design: The core of `go-sqlbuilder` is `Builder` and `Args`. Nearly all features are built on top of them. If we want to extend this package, e.g. support `EXPLAIN`, we can use `Build("EXPLAIN $?", builder)` to add `EXPLAIN` in front of any SQL.
- ORM: Package `squirrel` doesn't provide ORM directly. There is another package [structable](https://github.com/Masterminds/structable), which is based on `squirrel`, designed for ORM.
- No design pitfalls: There is no design pitfalls like `squirrel.Eq{"mynumber": []uint8{1,2,3}}`. I'm proud of it. :)
